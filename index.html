        <h1><strong>Fast Food</strong></h1>
        <p>Hamburgers, french fries, and soft drinks are typical fast food items. Fast food is a mass-produced food that is typically prepared and served quicker than traditional foods. The food is typically less nutritionally valuable compared to other foods and dishes. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away.</p>
